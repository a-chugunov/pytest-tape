Creates separate tape for each test file. Each tape stores results for all tests that have utilised tape fixture. supports parametrized tests, as long as all parameters can be jsonified. Hash functions are used to store and identify params. Expected results are stored as dictionaries in yaml, so that they can be compared using tolerances. Requirements python >= 3.6 Installation You can install pytest-tape via pip : pip install pytest-tape Usage Just use tape fixture in any of the tests and assert dictionary of results with it. def test_correctness(tape): result_of_calc = { 'a': [1,2,3], 'b':'Another_Random_Result', 'c': 45.99 } assert tape == result_of_calc First time the tests fails, tape writes to yaml file. Second and all subsequent times you run the test - it compares the result with what is on tape.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-pytest-tape","text":"Easy assertion with expected results saved to yaml files","title":"Welcome to pytest-tape"},{"location":"#features","text":"Creates yaml files for expected test results , a.k.a. tape.
